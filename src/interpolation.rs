  /// - The next control point also has a Bézier interpolation mode. In this case, its tangent is
  ///   used for the interpolation process. This is called _cubic Bézier interpolation_ and it
  ///   kicks ass.
  /// - The next control point doesn’t have a Bézier interpolation mode set. In this case, the
  ///   tangent used for the next control point is defined as the segment connecting that control
  ///   point and the current control point’s associated point. This is called _quadratic Bézer
